#     Scenario: Verify sort-function works as expected
#         Given I am on amazon
#         When I type '<item>' in search bar 
#         And I sort result by Price: Low to High
#         Then I verify prices are sorted as expected
#         Examples:
#             | item |
#             | iphone |
